Ralvz Technologies Mobile Phone Location Tracker - Ralvz Technologies MPLT

Ralvz Technologies Mobile Phone Location Tracker MVP specification based on the project information and addressing the prompt's requirements:

1. Introduction This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) specifications for the "Ralvz Technologies Mobile Phone Location Tracker" web application. The project aims to develop a user-friendly platform that allows users to track the location of phone numbers on a map, leveraging geolocation and geocoding APIs.

2. Architecture

Illustration 





















- User Interface (UI): Handles user interactions and displays data (web browser).
- Web Server: Processes user requests and interacts with the database and APIs.
- Database: Stores user information and potentially location history (if applicable).
- Geolocation API: Provides user's approximate location (if enabled on the device).
- Geocoding API: Translates phone numbers (or associated carrier data) into geographical coordinates.
- E-payment System (Optional): Facilitates secure payments for premium features (if implemented).

3. APIs and Methods

Web Client API Routes

These API routes enable communication between the web client and the web server:

- `/api/track` (POST):
    - Request Body: Contains the phone number to be tracked.
        - Response: Returns the retrieved location data (latitude, longitude) or an error message if unsuccessful.
	    - Authentication: Potential implementation to restrict unauthorized access.

	    4. Data Modeling

	    Data Model Diagram
	     
	     - `users` table:
	         - `id` (INT, Primary Key): Unique identifier for each user.
		     - `email` (str): User's username or email address for login.
		         - `password` (str, Hashed): Securely stored user password hash.
			     - `(optional)`: Additional user information if needed (e.g., subscription status for premium features).

			     - `track_requests` table:
			         - `id` (INT, Primary Key): Unique identifier for each tracking request.
				     - `user_id` (INT, Foreign Key): References the `id` in the `users` table.
				         - `phone_number` (str): The phone number that was tracked.
					     - `carrier` (str): The original carrier of the phone number that was tracked.
					         - `timestamp` (DATETIME): Date and time of the tracking request.
						     - `latitude` (float): Latitude coordinate of the retrieved location.
						         - `longitude` (float): Longitude coordinate of the retrieved location.

							 5. User Stories

							 User Story 1: As a registered user, I want to enter a phone number and see its location displayed on a map, so I can track the whereabouts of the phone's owner (if they have location services enabled and share their location).

							 User Story 2: As a system administrator, I want to be able to review user tracking activity logs (if applicable), so I can monitor system usage and identify any potential issues.

							 User Story 3: As a paying user (optional), I want to access premium features like real-time tracking or detailed location reports, so I can obtain more comprehensive location information.

							 6. Mockups

							 7. Next Steps

							 Upon approval of this MVP specification, the development process will commence. Key milestones include:

							 - Front-end development of the user interface.
							 - Back-end development to handle API interactions, database operations, and server-side logic.
							 - Integration of geolocation and geocoding APIs.
							 - Development of a secure authentication system.
							 - Testing and refinement of the MVP.

							 8. Conclusion

							 The Ralvz Technologies MPLT MVP will provide a valuable tool for users to track phone numbers on a map. The project will showcase our skills in web development, database management, and API integration, while adhering to data privacy considerations. We are confident that this application will be a successful addition to our portfolio.
